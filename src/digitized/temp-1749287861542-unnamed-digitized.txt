Historical Perspective  
Spinal Deformity and Axial Traction
Kush Kumar, MBBS, MS(Orth), DNB(PM&R), FAANOS, PhD
Axial traction to correct spinal deformity is a very
old concept. The oldest reference available is in ancient
Hindu mythological epics (written between 3500 BC
and 1800 BC) where it is mentioned how Lord Krishna
corrected the hunchback of one of his devotees. Later,
Hippocrates (460 BC to 377 BC) described certain de-
vices. Galen (131 AD to 201 AD), a follower of Hip-
pocrates, used axial traction with direct pressure. Ibn
Sena (980 AD to 1037 AD) in the Middle East also used
similar methods. Osteopaths of Turkey also used axial
traction to correct spinal deformities. But gradually me-
chanical methods for the correction of the spinal defor-
mity went into disrepute due to the invariable produc-
tion of paraplegia.
In the past few decades, interest in the correction of
spinal deformity has been rejuvenated due to better
understanding of anatomy, physiology, and pathome-
chanics of spinal deformity. Controlled axial traction
has been the keystone of several modern procedures
such as Cotrel traction, Halo traction, and Harrington
Outrigger instrumentation, etc.
It appears that the primitive ways of application of axial traction by crude methods did not totally vanish but have been modified. In Indian tribal areas, bone setters still practice it in modified form. [Key words: history, traction, scoliosis, kyphoscoliosis] Spine 1996; 21:653–655
The use of axial traction for the correction of spinal deformity is the basis of several corrective procedures existing today. Cotrel traction, Halo traction, and Harrington Outrigger instrumentations are various forms of this basic concept. It is interesting that the concept of using axial traction to correct spinal deformity existed even in prehistoric times.
Srimad Bhagwat Mahapuranam, an ancient Indian
religious literature written between 3500 BC and 1800
BC, describes several Hindu mythological epics. One
story tells of Lord Krishna correcting the hunchback of
one of his devotees, Kubja, by applying axial traction.
Kubja's back was deformed in three places; probably
having scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis with one primary and

“To shower the fruits of his blessings,
Happy Lord Krishna decided to straighten Kubja,
Who was deformed from three places.”
“He pressed her feet by his foot,
Held her chin by two fingers and pulled her up.
By the touch and pull of Lord,
She became a beautiful straight woman.”
Whether Lord Krishna really did straighten Kubja’s
spine or it was the flight of the human imagination is a
separate issue but it is certainly notable that the concept
of axial traction to correct spinal deformity existed even
in prehistoric times. *Srimad Bhagwat Mahapuranam* is
the oldest existing reference to axial traction (Kumar³)
(Figure 1).
Much later, Hippocrates (460 BC to 377 BC) used
axial traction to correct spinal deformity and even in-
vented special devices (Cyriax¹) (Figure 2). Galen (131
AD to 201 AD) took the concept one step further by
combining axial traction with direct pressure applied
mechanically by a manipulator (Roaf⁴) (Figure 3).
Ibn Sena (980 AD to 1037 AD) in the Middle East,
probably impressed by Galen’s concept, not only used
similar methods but also developed his own instruments
to correct spinal deformity (Iqbal²) (Figure 4). Similar
methods were also used in Turkey (Cyriax¹) (Figure
Several workers in Turkey tried different techniques  
to correct spinal deformities by various mechanical

  • The main subject is a person suspended upside down from a horizontal beam, tied at the ankles, with their body secured to a vertical ladder-like frame.
  • Two individuals, one on each side, are pulling ropes attached to the top of the frame, creating tension.
  • The setting includes two classical columns supporting the beam, suggesting an ancient architectural context.
  • The composition is symmetrical, with the suspended person centered and the two assistants mirrored on either side.
  • The illustration is black-and-white line art, with minimal shading.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The image is a redrawn version from a historical manuscript, as noted in the caption.
  • The only visible text is the figure legend and a small artist's signature "K.K." in the lower right.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The suspended person is centrally located, hanging vertically with the head downward.
  • The two assistants are positioned on raised platforms or steps, each holding a rope that passes over the beam and attaches to the frame.
  • The ropes are taut, indicating active pulling or tension.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains the 'Succussion' method, where spinal traction is applied by suspending the patient upside down and using assistants to create additional force via ropes.

  • The image highlights the historical context and mechanical approach to spinal correction in ancient medicine.
means but nothing worked. The effort of correcting the
spinal deformity was not only considered difficult but
even dangerous due to almost invariable production of
paraplegia. It was gradually realized that it is better to
live and work with a deformed spine than to die in
misery with paraplegia.
Despite such fears and warnings, the concept of axial
traction did not die. It stayed in the crude and primitive
form and even today is practiced by some of the 'bone
setters' in tribal regions of India.
Recently during a visit to one of the tribal regions of
Maharashtra, the author met a tribal bone setter exert-
ing powerful axial traction to one of the tribal girls who
was about 8 to 9 years of age (Figure 6). Later on during
examination of the child the author found that she had
mid-dorsal idiopathic scoliosis. The parents of the child
were ‘convinced’ that the child had improved by the
Summary : This illustration shows Galen's historical method for correcting spinal deformity, as redrawn from Roaf, using mechanical traction and force applied to a patient lying on a table.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image is divided into two panels, both depicting a patient lying face-down and restrained on a flat surface.
  • Left panel: A person uses a large lever to apply force to the patient, with a cracked brick wall in the background symbolizing the correction of a deformity.
  • Right panel: Another person stands on an inclined board attached to the patient, using their body weight to apply traction, while a rope and pulley system is also visible.
  • Both scenes are drawn in a simple, line-art style with minimal shading.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The illustration is labeled as "Figure 3. Galen’s method of correction of spinal deformity. Redrawn from Roaf."
  • The patient is restrained at both ends, and force is applied either by lever or by body weight and pulley.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Patient is centrally positioned in both panels, lying horizontally.
  • In the left panel, the lever is operated from the side; in the right panel, the operator stands above the patient on the inclined board.
  • The cracked wall in the left panel is behind the patient, visually emphasizing the concept of "breaking" or correcting the deformity.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains two mechanical methods for spinal correction: one using a lever and the other using body weight and pulleys.
  • The cracked wall metaphorically represents the breaking or correction of spinal deformity.
  • The image highlights the historical, physical approach to spinal treatment, emphasizing forceful mechanical intervention.
Summary : This figure illustrates three historical methods for the correction of spinal deformity attributed to Ibn Sena (Avicenna), showing the procedures and tools used, and highlighting their similarity to Galen’s methods. The images are redrawn from a set of pictures displayed at the Ibn Sena Symposium, University of Malaya in 1980.

Summary : This illustration demonstrates a traditional tribal method for exerting spinal traction, as depicted in a historical or ethnographic medical context.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a person suspended in the air by a rope tied around their upper torso, with their feet off the ground.
  • A second person, likely a tribal healer or assistant, operates a long lever (pole) attached to a forked upright support, which acts as a fulcrum.
  • The suspended individual is positioned at the end of the lever, while the operator applies downward force on the opposite end.
  • The setting is outdoors, with minimal background detail, focusing attention on the apparatus and the two individuals.
  • The illustration is black-and-white, line-drawn, and includes a caption at the bottom: "Figure 6. Tribal Method of exerting spinal traction."

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are provided.
  • The apparatus consists of a long, straight pole (lever) resting on a forked vertical support (tree or wooden post).
  • The rope is looped over the end of the lever and tied securely around the suspended person's upper body.
  • The operator is barefoot and dressed in traditional attire.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The suspended person is on the right side of the image, hanging vertically.
  • The operator stands to the left, holding and pressing down on the lever's free end.
  • The fulcrum (forked support) is centrally placed, with the lever angled upward from left to right.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains a mechanical method for applying spinal traction using a lever and fulcrum system, relying on body weight and manual force.
  • The setup allows controlled, adjustable traction force to be applied to the suspended individual, likely for therapeutic or traditional medical purposes.
  • The image highlights the ingenuity of traditional practices in the absence of modern medical equipment.
Summary : This illustration demonstrates a method for applying more powerful traction to a patient suspended from a tree, by adding extra weight to the foot end using a rope and a second person.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a person (the patient) suspended from a tree by a rope harness, with another person on the ground pulling on a rope attached to the patient's foot end.
  • The setting is outdoors, with a large tree as the central element.
  • The perspective is a side view, showing both the patient and the assistant clearly.
  • The composition places the tree centrally, with the patient hanging to the right and the assistant standing to the left.
  • The illustration is black-and-white line art, with minimal shading or detail.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The rope is shown wrapped around the tree trunk and extending to the assistant, who is pulling on it with their foot braced against the tree.
  • The patient is suspended with knees bent and arms crossed, supported by a harness or sling.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The patient is elevated off the ground, hanging from a branch on the right side of the tree.
  • The assistant stands on the left side of the tree, pulling the rope downward and away from the trunk.
  • The rope forms a continuous line from the branch, around the trunk, and to the assistant, indicating a mechanical advantage for traction.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains how an assistant can increase traction force on a suspended patient by pulling on a rope attached to the foot end, using the tree as an anchor and lever.
  • The setup suggests a field or emergency medical context where improvised traction is needed.
  • The method leverages body weight and mechanical advantage to enhance the traction applied to the patient.
further said that if a more powerful pull is needed then
some extra force is applied (Figures 7 and 8). He
claimed that he had never seen any complications due to
his method of traction but he was certain that weight
Summary : This illustration demonstrates a traditional method for applying traction to a patient by using a lever system, where additional weight is attached to the foot end to increase the traction force.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a patient suspended vertically by the feet from a rope, with a large cylindrical weight attached to the foot end.
  • Two individuals are operating a long wooden lever: one person sits at the far end, pulling downward, while the other stands and pushes down closer to the fulcrum.
  • The lever is supported by a forked tree trunk acting as a fulcrum.
  • The setting appears outdoors, with minimal background detail.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.
  • The patient is suspended by a rope tied to the feet, with the head pointing downward.
  • The lever is a long, straight pole, and the weight is a large, round object tied to the end near the patient.
  • The illustration is black-and-white, line-drawn, and includes a caption: "Figure 7. For more powerful traction, extra weight is applied to the foot end of the patient."

Spatial Relationships :
  • The patient is at the rightmost end, hanging vertically.
  • The lever extends diagonally from the patient to the left, with the fulcrum (tree) near the right.
  • The two operators are positioned along the lever, one at the far left end and one closer to the fulcrum.

Analysis :
  • The image visually explains how increasing the weight at the foot end of the patient, and applying force via a lever, can enhance traction for medical purposes.
  • The arrangement leverages mechanical advantage to apply greater force with less effort from the operators.
  • The setup is simple and relies on basic materials, illustrating a low-technology solution for traction.
