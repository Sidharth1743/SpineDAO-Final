Historical Perspective  
Spinal Deformity and Axial Traction
Kush Kumar, MBBS, MS(Orth), DNB(PM&R), FAANOS, PhD
Axial traction to correct spinal deformity is a very
old concept. The oldest reference available is in ancient
Hindu mythological epics (written between 3500 BC
and 1800 BC) where it is mentioned how Lord Krishna
corrected the hunchback of one of his devotees. Later,
Hippocrates (460 BC to 377 BC) described certain de-
vices. Galen (131 AD to 201 AD), a follower of Hip-
pocrates, used axial traction with direct pressure. Ibn
Sena (980 AD to 1037 AD) in the Middle East also used
similar methods. Osteopaths of Turkey also used axial
traction to correct spinal deformities. But gradually me-
chanical methods for the correction of the spinal defor-
mity went into disrepute due to the invariable produc-
tion of paraplegia.
In the past few decades, interest in the correction of
spinal deformity has been rejuvenated due to better
understanding of anatomy, physiology, and pathome-
chanics of spinal deformity. Controlled axial traction
has been the keystone of several modern procedures
such as Cotrel traction, Halo traction, and Harrington
Outrigger instrumentation, etc.
It appears that the primitive ways of application of axial traction by crude methods did not totally vanish but have been modified. In Indian tribal areas, bone setters still practice it in modified form. [Key words: history, traction, scoliosis, kyphoscoliosis] Spine 1996; 21:653–655
The use of axial traction for the correction of spinal deformity is the basis of several corrective procedures existing today. Cotrel traction, Halo traction, and Harrington Outrigger instrumentations are various forms of this basic concept. It is interesting that the concept of using axial traction to correct spinal deformity existed even in prehistoric times.
Srimad Bhagwat Mahapuranam, an ancient Indian
religious literature written between 3500 BC and 1800
BC, describes several Hindu mythological epics. One
story tells of Lord Krishna correcting the hunchback of
one of his devotees, Kubja, by applying axial traction.
Kubja's back was deformed in three places; probably
having scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis with one primary and

two secondary curves. The exact English translation of
the original Sanskrit verse is as follows (from Kumar³):

  “To shower the fruits of his blessings,
  Happy Lord Krishna decided to straighten Kubja,
  Who was deformed from three places.”
  “He pressed her feet by his foot,
  Held her chin by two fingers and pulled her up.
  By the touch and pull of Lord,
  She became a beautiful straight woman.”
Whether Lord Krishna really did straighten Kubja’s
spine or it was the flight of the human imagination is a
separate issue but it is certainly notable that the concept
of axial traction to correct spinal deformity existed even
in prehistoric times. *Srimad Bhagwat Mahapuranam* is
the oldest existing reference to axial traction (Kumar³)
(Figure 1).
Much later, Hippocrates (460 BC to 377 BC) used
axial traction to correct spinal deformity and even in-
vented special devices (Cyriax¹) (Figure 2). Galen (131
AD to 201 AD) took the concept one step further by
combining axial traction with direct pressure applied
mechanically by a manipulator (Roaf⁴) (Figure 3).
Ibn Sena (980 AD to 1037 AD) in the Middle East,
probably impressed by Galen’s concept, not only used
similar methods but also developed his own instruments
to correct spinal deformity (Iqbal²) (Figure 4). Similar
methods were also used in Turkey (Cyriax¹) (Figure
Several workers in Turkey tried different techniques  
to correct spinal deformities by various mechanical

means but nothing worked. The effort of correcting the
spinal deformity was not only considered difficult but
even dangerous due to almost invariable production of
paraplegia. It was gradually realized that it is better to
live and work with a deformed spine than to die in
misery with paraplegia.
Despite such fears and warnings, the concept of axial
traction did not die. It stayed in the crude and primitive
form and even today is practiced by some of the 'bone
setters' in tribal regions of India.
Recently during a visit to one of the tribal regions of
Maharashtra, the author met a tribal bone setter exert-
ing powerful axial traction to one of the tribal girls who
was about 8 to 9 years of age (Figure 6). Later on during
examination of the child the author found that she had
mid-dorsal idiopathic scoliosis. The parents of the child
were ‘convinced’ that the child had improved by the
Summary : This illustration shows Galen's historical method for correcting spinal deformity, as redrawn from Roaf, using mechanical traction and manual force.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image is divided into two panels, both depicting a patient lying face down on a flat surface (table or bed) with their limbs secured.
  • Left panel: A person uses a lever to apply traction to the patient, who is tied at the ankles and wrists, with a wall of bricks in the background symbolizing the spine.
  • Right panel: Another person stands on the patient’s back, applying downward force while the patient is stretched by ropes attached to a winch or pulley system.
  • The style is line drawing, black and white, with simple human figures in ancient attire.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or magnification is present.
  • The illustration is labeled as “Figure 3. Galen’s method of correction of spinal deformity. Redrawn from Roaf.”
  • The patient is shown immobilized, with mechanical devices (lever, ropes, winch) used to apply force.

Spatial Relationships :
  • In both panels, the patient is centrally positioned, lying horizontally.
  • The operator in the left panel is kneeling beside the patient, while in the right panel, the operator stands on the patient’s back.
  • The mechanical apparatus is attached to the ends of the table/bed, pulling in opposite directions.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains an ancient technique for spinal correction involving both traction (stretching) and direct manual pressure.
  • The use of a brick wall in the left panel metaphorically represents the spine and its deformity.
  • The two-step process suggests simultaneous or sequential application of longitudinal traction and vertical force to correct spinal alignment.
Summary : This figure illustrates three historical methods for the correction of spinal deformity attributed to Ibn Sena (Avicenna), showing the procedures and tools used, and highlighting their similarity to Galen’s methods. The images are redrawn from a set of pictures displayed at the Ibn Sena Symposium, University of Malaya in 1980.

Summary : This illustration demonstrates a traditional tribal method for exerting spinal traction, using a lever system to apply force to a suspended individual.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a person suspended by a rope in a harness-like arrangement, with their back facing the viewer and feet off the ground.
  • A long horizontal pole is attached to a vertical support (tree trunk or branch), forming a lever.
  • Another person, standing on the ground, is pushing down on the free end of the horizontal pole to exert force.
  • The setting is outdoors, with minimal background detail, focusing attention on the apparatus and the two individuals.
  • The illustration is black-and-white line art, with simple, clear outlines.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.
  • The apparatus consists of a sturdy vertical support, a long horizontal pole acting as a lever, and a rope or harness system for suspension.
  • The person applying force is barefoot and dressed in traditional attire.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The suspended individual is on the right side of the image, hanging vertically.
  • The lever system extends diagonally from the upper right (where the person is suspended) to the lower left (where the force is applied).
  • The person applying force is positioned at the far end of the lever, maximizing mechanical advantage.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains how mechanical advantage is used to apply spinal traction in a traditional context, with one person able to exert significant force on another's spine using a simple lever system.
  • The setup highlights the use of basic physics (lever principle) in indigenous medical practices for spinal treatment.
Summary : This illustration demonstrates a method for applying more powerful traction to a patient suspended from a tree, by adding extra weight to the foot end using a rope and a second person.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a patient suspended in a harness from a tree branch, with their arms crossed and knees bent.
  • A second person stands on the ground, holding and pulling a rope that is wrapped around the tree trunk and attached to the patient's feet.
  • The setting is outdoors, with a large tree dominating the scene.
  • The perspective is side-on, showing both the patient and the person applying traction.
  • The illustration is black-and-white line art, with simple outlines and minimal shading.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The rope is shown looped around the tree trunk for mechanical advantage.
  • The patient is suspended by a harness or sling, with the rope attached to their feet.
  • The person on the ground is using their body weight to pull the rope downward.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The patient is elevated off the ground, hanging vertically from a branch.
  • The rope runs from the patient's feet, around the tree trunk, and down to the person applying traction.
  • The person applying traction is positioned to the left of the tree, bracing themselves with one foot against the trunk.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains how additional force can be applied to a suspended patient by having another person pull on a rope attached to the patient's feet, increasing traction for medical or rescue purposes.
  • The use of the tree trunk as a pulley increases mechanical advantage, allowing the person on the ground to apply greater force with less effort.
further said that if a more powerful pull is needed then
some extra force is applied (Figures 7 and 8). He
claimed that he had never seen any complications due to
his method of traction but he was certain that weight
Summary : This illustration demonstrates a traditional method for applying traction to a patient using a lever system, where additional weight is added to increase the force at the patient's foot end.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a patient suspended vertically by the feet from a rope attached to a long wooden pole, which acts as a lever.
  • Two people are operating the lever: one person is seated at the short end of the pole, applying downward force, while another stands and pushes down on the pole further along its length.
  • The lever is supported by a forked tree trunk acting as a fulcrum.
  • A heavy object (possibly a stone or weight) is attached to the rope at the foot end of the patient to provide traction.
  • The setting is outdoors, with minimal background detail.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The illustration is black-and-white line art.
  • Caption text reads: "Figure 7. For more powerful traction, extra weight is applied to the foot end of the patient."

Spatial Relationships :
  • The patient is suspended vertically at the far right, with the rope and weight directly below the feet.
  • The lever extends diagonally from the patient to the left, with the fulcrum (tree trunk) near the middle.
  • The two operators are positioned at different points along the lever, maximizing mechanical advantage.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains how increasing weight at the foot end of the patient, combined with lever action, can enhance the traction force applied for medical purposes.
  • The setup leverages basic mechanical principles to multiply force, allowing greater traction with less effort from the operators.
  • The scene emphasizes the use of simple tools and teamwork in a resource-limited setting.
